Everything that needs to be done
generate plots
    Moment diagram
    Shear diagram
    Torque diagram
plot at 3 different fuel levels
plot every critical case from the flight envelope
plot the stiffness distribution
calculate deflection
calculate twist
calculate required skin and spar thickness given a material

table of known assumptions
    Cl
    Cd
Description of the wing

stuff that would be nice:
easily evaluate for different materials and cases
make the whole process more comprehensive
simplify the code 
beter documentation
